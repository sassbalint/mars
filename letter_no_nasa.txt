Dear NASA,

Perseverance's landing on Mars is a great achievement of humankind!

I check your site regularly and if I am not mistaken,
the time Perseverance have spent on Mars
-- see "SOLS ON MARS" at the bottom of
https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020 page -- is wrong.

Please consider my calculation below
and look at the attached screenshot it is based on here:
XXX XXX XXX

Perseverance landed: Feb. 18, 2021, 3:55 pm EST

at the moment of taking the screenshot
"sols on mars" as shown on your site is: 10 sol 8h 20m 41s

according to wikipedia one sol is: 24h 39m 35s

10 sol 8h 20m 41s =
10 * (24h 39m 35s) + 8h 20m 41s =
10 day 14h 56m 31s

Feb. 18, 2021, 3:55 pm EST
+ 10 day 14h 56m 31s
= Mar. 1, 2021, 6:51 am EST

but at the moment of taking the screenshot
https://time.is/en/EST shows
Feb. 28. 2021, 2:34 pm EST

So there seems to be quite a big difference.
What do you think?

If maybe my calculation is erroneous, show me where, please.

Thank you and keep up the good work:
